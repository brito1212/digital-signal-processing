## Introduction

This project is focused on exploring various concepts and techniques in Digital Signal Processing. The studies are conducted using Jupyter Notebooks, leveraging the MATLAB library for signal transformations and functions.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSP_Studies.git
    cd DSP_Studies
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
    ```sh
    pip install jupyter
    pip install matlab
    ```

4. **Install MATLAB Engine API for Python**:
    ```sh
    cd "matlabroot\extern\engines\python"
    python setup.py install
    ```

## Usage

To start working with the notebooks:

1. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open any of the notebooks to start exploring DSP concepts.
